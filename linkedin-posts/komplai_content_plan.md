# Larry Launch Content Plan (Utility-First Edition)

**Goal:** Drive awareness and waitlist signups by providing *high-utility actionable resources* (Templates, Checklists, Frameworks) that solve immediate problems, positioning Larry as the ultimate tool.
**Cadence:** 3 Posts / Week

## Strategy: The "Finance Stack Architect"
Each post must act as a mini-tool or audit that the CFO can use *right now*.
