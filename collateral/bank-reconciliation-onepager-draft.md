# Bank Reconciliation One-Pager Draft

**Target Audience:** Controllers, CFOs, Finance Teams

---

## Headline

**Stop Spending Hours Matching Transactions**

## Subhead

Bank reconciliation that learns your patterns and handles matching automatically. You focus on exceptions that need judgment.

---

## The Problem

Bank reconciliation eats up hours every month. Transaction descriptions are vague. Volumes keep growing. TDS and tax adjustments need manual calculation. And every month, you're looking up the same vendors and making the same matching decisions you made last month.

---

## The Solution

### 1. Matching with confidence scores

Komplai matches bank transactions to your accounting records and shows you why. Each match includes a confidence score and reasoning.

- Exact matches on vendor and amount get 100% confidence
- Matches based on historical patterns show similarity percentages
- TDS-adjusted matches calculate net amounts automatically

### 2. Memory that learns from your team

The AI remembers how you've handled similar transactions. When something new arrives, it references past decisions to suggest matches.

"Memory Lookup" badges appear when the AI found a pattern from your history. When people leave, their knowledge stays in the system.

### 3. Sorted by confidence

Transactions land in three queues:

- Fast Track: High-confidence matches, one-click approval
- Needs Review: Lower confidence, needs your judgment
- Completed: Done
