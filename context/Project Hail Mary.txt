Project Hail Mary
==================

Last Updated: January 28, 2026


Overview
--------
April 1, 2026, will be 1 year since Komplai made its first public launch. The launch was impactful in the sense that it drove adoption (in the short-term), but also provided an opportunity for us to associate with a narrative. We did not play into this strongly for multiple reasons - but this launch will be managed differently. 

The purpose of this launch is to show our users that Komplai: 
1. Generates outcomes and gets things done. It is not just another observability platform. 
   1. Any functionalities we prioritise from the below have to deliver something tangible - PDFs, charts, data tables, or work done that they or their team would otherwise have to spend time on - emailing customers, creating vouchers/entries directly into the ERP, etc. 
2. Delivers value that the user would have to pay money to obtain, either to an external or an internal resource.
3. Use Larry as a product wedge to create opportunities to upsell the complete Book Close module to finance teams.

This document captures the project plan for the April 1, 2026, launch. The intention behind creating this document is 2 fold: (i) capture the whats of the launch, (ii) the whys, (iii) the hows, and most importantly, (iv) whether this is worth it. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION A: FUNCTIONALITIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following captures the immediate set of functionalities that the user would have access to when they sign up on the platform, for the first time, from April 1 onwards: 

1. Integration with their ERP: 
   1. Komplai will support integrations with Zoho, QBO, ERPNext and Xero out-of-the-box. 
   2. Through the integration with their ERP, the user will be able to access all business finance information on the Komplai platform: 
      1. Auto-populate existing tabs minus Book Close. Book Close tab shows with a lock icon. 

2. Larry → Insights & Reports:
   1. Using the data from the ERP (exclusively) position Larry as the finance assistant. 
   2. Larry should be able to perform the following tasks (illustrative - we can pull the functionalities from Midday):
      1. Cash flow and burn analysis
      2. Growth and churn analysis - using invoice information as the reference. 
      3. Non-negotiable (and our differentiator) → MIS report preparation on the upload of the MIS template being used by the customer. Note: If no template is provided/uploaded, we generate the MIS report in Komplai's subscribed template. 

3. [NEW] Larry → Close Tracker:
   Larry doesn't *do* the book close—but Larry *observes* it. By ingesting ERP data, Larry provides visibility into the close process:
   
      1. Track Progress: 
         1. "You've reconciled 65% of transactions. 35% remain."
         2. "12 of 25 journal entries posted for this period."
   
      2. Predict Timelines (Historical Trend Analysis):
         1. "Based on your last 6 closes, you typically finish on Day 8. You're on pace for Day 10 this month."
         2. "At current velocity, estimated close date: [Date]"
   
      3. Surface Bottlenecks:
         1. "Bank reconciliation is your slowest step—averaging 3.2 days vs. 1.5 days for invoice validation."
         2. "Accruals are taking 40% longer than last month."
   
      4. Upsell Trigger (The Wedge):
         1. When surfacing bottlenecks, Larry can show: "Companies using Komplai's automation close in 5 days vs. your current 12-day average. Want to see how?"
         2. This creates implicit sales pressure without a hard pitch.
   
   Implementation Notes:
      1. Start simple: 3-5 predefined close phases (Invoice Validation, Bank Recon, Journal Entries, Provisions, Payroll)
      2. Progress measured by ERP activity (# entries posted, # transactions reconciled)
      3. No task assignment or workflow features in Free/Scaling tier (that's Enterprise Book Close territory)
      4. Frame insights positively: "You're 20% behind your usual pace. Here's what's taking longer: [Bank Recon]" rather than purely negative messaging.
   
   Risk Mitigation:
      1. Accuracy depends on ERP data quality. Position as "based on ERP activity" with clear disclaimers.
      2. Allow manual status overrides if users track work outside ERP.

4. Email Sync or Auto-forwarding: 
   Note: Might not be required if we are syncing directly with an ERP, but will be required if we enable points 5 and 6. 
   1. For users on the Google Workspace, a Gmail sync that allows the automatic push of invoices/bills. 
      1. Note: Either manage multiple invoices in one email, or find a way to communicate that the user needs to forward invoices/bills in individual emails for Komplai to be able to pick them up. 
   2. For non-Google Workspace users, an email forwarding functionality that does the same as 4.a. 

5. JV Automation - AP v. AR:
   1. Through the ERP sync, we autopopulate the COAs. 
   2. Through the email sync/auto-forwarding rules, we sync invoices and map them to the sync-ed COAs on an ongoing basis. 
   3. The Book Close page is automatically updated to create a new project every month. 
   4. Tasks are created for the user to validate weekly → Saturday morning. As part of the validation flow, we show the users the following: 
      1. Total income for that week
      2. Total expenses for that week
      3. Total outstanding on both fronts (via the bank recon)
      4. Options to send reminder emails for AR unpaid (Optional).

6. Bank Recon - Manual Upload (or ERP Sync?):
   1. Every fortnight, the user is prompted to upload their bank statements as part of the weekly emails they receive. 
   2. Once the bank statement is uploaded, the current workflow is followed as part of the Book Close. 
   3. Scope for Book Close → 
      1. JV automation
      2. Recon entry automation 
      3. Payroll accounting (Optional)
      4. Sync with ERP

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION B: USER JOURNEY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an illustrative journey for the user: 
1. Lands on the website → navigates to and then clicks the Sign Up button.
2. Completes the existing sign-up flow
3. Lands on the dashboard → prompted to integrate ERP
4. Once the immediate data sync is completed, users receive an email → 'Larry is ready to help you with your questions'
5. User is navigated to the dashboard, which has a 'Chat with Larry' CTA below the current chart
6. Conversations with Larry creates assets that users can download (or pin to dashboard?)
7. [NEW] During close periods, Larry proactively shows close progress:
   1. "Your November close is 45% complete. Bank recon is pending."
   2. "At current pace, you'll finish 2 days later than last month."
8. Larry prompts the user to keep their data updated. Larry also shows a CTA to contact sales. 
   1. Sales takes over from here and enables functionalities 4, 5, and 6 through sales qualification and feature plays.

[NEW] Sales Handoff Triggers:
1. User hits the 10-question limit on Free tier
2. User asks about multi-entity consolidation
3. Close Tracker shows consistent bottlenecks that automation would solve
4. User's company matches ICP signals (Series B+, 10+ finance team - via enrichment)
5. User explicitly asks about Book Close or automation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION D: GO-TO-MARKET & BUDGET
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will deploy Rs. 6,00,000 (~$7,200 USD) over a period of 6-months for the distribution of this project.

[REVISED] Channel Allocation:

1. Google AdWords (40% of budget - Rs. 2,40,000)
   1. Bid on Komplai, Larry, Burn/Cashflow/Projections automation and MIS Automation
   2. Avoid bidding on continuous close or book close (premium keywords, enterprise focus)
   3. Focus on US market for paid acquisition

2. LinkedIn Retargeting (20% of budget - Rs. 1,20,000)
   1. Use website visitors to target these folks on LinkedIn
   2. CFO/Controller/Finance Director job titles only

3. [NEW] Content & SEO (30% of budget - Rs. 1,80,000)
   1. Rationale: Paid spend stops when budget stops. Content compounds over time.
   2. Target keywords identified in competitive intelligence:
      - "why does month end close take so long" (low competition, high intent)
      - "MIS automation" (our differentiator)
      - "AI finance assistant" (Larry positioning)
   3. Content pieces:
      - "The Hidden Cost of Manual Month-End Close" (problem-aware)
      - "How to Build MIS Reports Without Spreadsheets" (Larry + MIS angle)
      - "Close Automation for Startups: What You Actually Need" (market segmentation)
   4. Distribution via LinkedIn organic (founder posts), finance newsletters

4. [NEW] Launch Event (10% of budget - Rs. 60,000)
   1. Consider Product Hunt launch for awareness
   2. Webinar: "Ask Larry: Live Demo of AI Finance Analysis"
   3. Partner with 1-2 finance influencers/newsletter operators for launch day amplification


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION E: PHASED LAUNCH APPROACH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[NEW] Given the timeline (9 weeks from today to April 1), we recommend a phased approach to de-risk execution:

PHASE 1: April 1, 2026 (Core Launch)
   - ERP Integration (Zoho, QBO, ERPNext, Xero)
   - Larry → Insights & Reports (cash flow, burn, MIS)
   - Larry → Close Tracker (basic progress tracking)
   - Starter and Scaling tiers live
   - Self-serve onboarding

PHASE 2: May 1, 2026 (Automation Launch)
   - Email sync / auto-forwarding
   - JV Automation (AP/AR)
   - Bank Recon (manual upload)
   - Growth tier goes live
   - Close Tracker → full features (timeline predictions, bottleneck analysis)

PHASE 3: June 1, 2026 (Enterprise Push)
   - Full Book Close module positioning
   - Multi-entity consolidation emphasis
   - Enterprise tier active sales push
   - Case studies from Phase 1 early adopters

Rationale:
   - Phase 1 delivers the core wedge (Larry + ERP) without automation complexity
   - Phase 2 adds automation once core flows are proven
   - Phase 3 leverages 2 months of user data for Enterprise sales conversations

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION F: SUCCESS METRICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[REVISED] With more conservative conversion assumptions based on industry benchmarks:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION G: RISKS & MITIGATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[NEW SECTION]

1. ERP Data Quality Risk
   - Issue: Larry's Close Tracker accuracy depends on ERP reflecting real-time activity
   - Mitigation: Clear disclaimers ("based on ERP activity"), manual override options

2. Free Tier Abuse
   - Issue: Users stay on Free forever without converting
   - Mitigation: Daily question limits, 7-day chat history, no downloads/exports

3. Timeline Execution Risk
   - Issue: 9 weeks is tight for full scope
   - Mitigation: Phased launch approach (see Section E)

4. Competitive Response
   - Issue: Midday or competitors could copy Larry-style features
   - Mitigation: MIS automation and Close Tracker as differentiators; first-mover advantage

5. Conversion Below Expectations
   - Issue: If 5% Free→Scaling doesn't materialize
   - Mitigation: A/B test pricing, add growth tier as stepping stone, increase Larry value (more features in free tier to build habit)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION H: OPEN QUESTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[NEW SECTION]

1. Close Tracker Phase Definitions
   - What are the 3-5 close phases we'll track?
   - How do we detect "completion" of each phase via ERP data?

2. Growth Tier Scope
   - Exactly which Book Close features go into Growth vs. Enterprise?
   - Do we risk cannibalizing Enterprise pipeline?

3. Mobile/Slack Distribution
   - Should Larry be accessible via Slack/Teams for quick queries?
   - Does this improve engagement enough to justify the build?

4. Virality Mechanisms
   - Should exported reports have "Powered by Komplai" watermarks?
   - Referral program for free users?

5. Sales Handoff Automation
   - How do we technically detect ICP signals for sales handoff?
   - CRM integration needed?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
