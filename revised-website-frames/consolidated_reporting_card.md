## 3. Recommended FAQ (Consolidation Focused)
*   **How long does it take to consolidate multiple entities?** *(Komplai performs continuous consolidation. As soon as a local entity posts a journal, the group-level reporting updates in real-time.)*
*   **Does this support inter-company eliminations?** *(Yes, Larry identifies inter-company transactions across the group and flags them for automated elimination, providing a perfectly balanced consolidated view.)*
*   **Which exchange rates does the system use?** *(Komplai pulls live mid-market rates daily or uses your organization's specific month-end spot rates for GAAP/IFRS compliance.)*
