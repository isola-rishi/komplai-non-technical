### 1. Hero Section
*Ref: Screenshot .07.08*

*   **Label:** `For Controllers`
*   **Headline:** Financial Close Control System for Controllers.
*   **Sub-Headline:** Run the entire close from one place: tasks, reconciliations, and journals. Exceptions surface early so your review stays focused through every stage of the month-end close.
*   **Primary CTA:** `Get Started Now`

### 2. The "Tighter Controls" Value Prop
*Ref: Screenshot .07.14*

*   **Label:** `Why Choose Komplai?`
*   **Headline:** Faster closes. Tighter controls. Less rework.
*   **Sub-Headline:** Komplai gives you real-time visibility into the month-end close across tasks, reconciliations, and journals. Larry handles the repetitive checks, flags exceptions, and keeps evidence attached, so reviews are quicker and CFO reporting doesn’t turn into a last-minute rescue mission.
*   **Primary CTA:** `Get Started Now`
*   **Visual Elements:**
    *   **Team Status:** Track reconciliation tasks by team (Receivables, Payables, Payroll, Bank Recon).
    *   **Task Overview:** 105 Tasks (Not Started, In Progress, On Review, Completed).
    *   **Progress Chart:** Daily Created vs. Completed Tasks visualization.

### 3. Core Controller Pillars
*Ref: Screenshot .07.14 / .07.17*

*   **Pillar 01: Team-Level Visibility**
    *   **Description:** Monitor close progress by entity, account, and owner. Know exactly what’s blocked, what’s late, and what’s at risk without chasing manual updates or status meetings.
*   **Pillar 02: Built-In Controls**
    *   **Description:** Maker-checker by default. Every journal entry, bank reconciliation, and adjustment is prepared by AI and reviewed by your team, with a permanent audit trail.
*   **Pillar 03: Cleaner Closes**
    *   **Description:** Move to exception-based review. Catch miscodes, missing documentation, duplicates, and unusual movements as they happen, not 15 days later.

### 4. Close Efficiency Section
*Ref: Screenshot .07.19*

*   **Label:** `How it works`
*   **Headline:** Real-time data and insight.
*   **Sub-Headline:** Run the close from one place with live status, automated checks, and exception lists. Larry keeps reconciliations tight and journals review-ready, so you're not managing the close over Slack and spreadsheets.
*   **Key Metrics:**
    *   **50%** — Fewer review loops and back-and-forth corrections.
    *   **100%** — Close tasks tracked end-to-end with attached evidence.

    *   **Monitor Close Progress in Real Time:** Track every close task, owner, and deadline as it happens across entities. Spot bottlenecks early and keep the close calendar predictable.
    *   **Review Entries Without Manual Overhead:** Larry flags high-risk and exception entries for review with full context. Spend your time validating the few items that matter, not sampling blindly.
    *   **Manage Team Performance and Workload:** See turnaround time, bottlenecks, and reopen rates by person and function. Rebalance workload before delays cascade into month-end.
