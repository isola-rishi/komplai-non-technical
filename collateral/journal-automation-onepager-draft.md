## The Problem

Finance teams spend 60%+ of their time on manual, repetitive journal entries. Month-end closes get delayed by data entry backlogs. When team members leave, their knowledge leaves with them. Different people classify the same transactions differently.

These problems compound. Your team stays stuck on data entry instead of analysis and strategy.

## The Solution: Journal Automation with Memory

### Column 1: Automated Journal Entries

Recurring accruals post automatically. Amortization and deferral schedules calculate from invoice service periods. TDS and withholding taxes apply based on expense type.

Your team stops re-entering the same data month after month.

### Column 2: Memory That Learns

Komplai's AI watches how your team classifies transactions. When it recognizes a pattern, it shows "Classified from Memory" with a confidence score.

Knowledge stays in the system even when people leave. Classifications stay consistent across your whole team.

### Column 3: Directives You Control

Teach the AI your rules. Choose how broadly to apply each pattern, from narrow vendor-specific rules to broad category-wide policies.

You keep oversight. The AI handles the repetitive work.
