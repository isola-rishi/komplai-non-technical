*Ref: Screenshot .04.59*

*   **Label:** `FAQs`
*   **Headline:** We’re here to answer your questions.
*   **Subtext:** Clear answers, no fluff. We've designed Komplai to feel intuitive from day one, but here’s where we answer the most common questions about accruals and deferrals.
*   **Proposed Questions:**
    *   How does Larry identify missing invoices that require accrual? *(He monitors historical monthly patterns and contract start/end dates to flag expected costs that haven't arrived.)*
    *   Can we customize the amortisation logic for different categories? *(Absolutely. You set the rules—linear, threshold-based, or event-driven—and Larry executes the schedule.)*
    *   Does this support ASC 606 / IFRS 15 revenue recognition? *(Yes, Komplai is designed to support the 5-step model for revenue recognition, ensuring GAAP/IFRS compliance.)*
    *   What happens when the actual invoice amount differs from the accrual? *(Larry suggests a "True-up" entry to adjust the variance and handles the reversal of the original estimate automatically.)*
