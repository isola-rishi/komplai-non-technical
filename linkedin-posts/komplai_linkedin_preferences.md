# Larry Launch Content Style Guide

This document captures the specific preferences, constraints, and tonal guidelines for the 9-week Larry launch campaign. 
**Use this file as a prompt prefix when drafting all future weeks.**

## 1. Core Persona & Voice
*   **The Persona:** "The Expert Observer."
    *   *Do NOT write as:* A struggling founder or victim ("I am tired of waiting...").
    *   *DO write as:* A consultant/expert diagnosing the industry ("The number one complaint I hear from CEOs is...").
*   **The Tone:**
    *   **Controversial:** Challenge the status quo ("Your finance process is a hostage situation").
    *   **Conversational:** Short sentences. Human language. No corporate jargon.
    *   **Punchy Hooks:** Stop the scroll ("I stopped asking for reports").

## 2. Target Audience
*   **Primary:** CEOs, CFOs, Controllers (Finance Leaders).
*   **Secondary:** Finance Managers.
*   **Negative Constraint:** Do NOT target "Founders" or "Startups" generically. Focus on "Growing Companies" and "Finance Leaders."

## 3. Launch Strategy & "The Reveal"
*   **Phase 1 & 2 (Weeks 1-6):** The "Tease" Phase.
    *   **Constraint:** **NEVER mention "Larry" by name.**
    *   **Naming:** Use "Komplai," "Modern Solutions," or "The System."
    *   **Focus:** Sell the *mechanism* (Continuous Consolidation, Institutional Memory), not the *agent*.
*   **Phase 3 (Weeks 7-9):** The "Reveal" Phase.
    *   **Action:** Introduce "Larry" as the AI agent that delivers the Phase 1 & 2 promises.

## 4. Content Format: "Utility-First"
Every post must include a specific, actionable diagnostic tool.
*   **The Audit:** "Run this stopwatch test."
*   **The Scorecard:** "Rate your process A, B, C, or F."
*   **The Map:** "Draw your entity structure. Color manual links RED."
*   **The Calculus:** "Calculate your Bus Factor."

## 5. Key Themes & Vocabulary
*   **Latency:** "Business Speed," "Decision Latency," "Black Box."
*   **Dependency:** "Bus Factor," "Hostage Situation," "Renting your process."
*   **Complexity:** "Data Janitorial Work," "Fragility Bomb," "Excel Sheets in a Trench Coat."
*   **Solution:** "Institutional Memory," "Continuous Consolidation," "Maker vs Checker."

## 6. Formatting Rules
*   **Headlines:** Must be provocative/statement-based.
*   **Structure:** Hook -> Agitation (Story) -> The Audit (Utility) -> The Fix (Komplai).
*   **Visuals:** Describe a simple visual concept for each post (e.g., "A stopwatch," "A red arrow map").
