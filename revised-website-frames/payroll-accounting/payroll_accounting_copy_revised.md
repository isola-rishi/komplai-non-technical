*   **Section Title:** How Komplai Helps
*   **Feature 01: Automated Payroll Journals**
    *   **Description:** Larry generates payroll entries across salary, deductions, employer costs, etc., using your exact chart-of-accounts and journal entry automation intelligence. No more manual mapping for every pay cycle.
*   **Feature 02: Mapping and Validation Controls**

*   **Feature 03: Payroll-to-Ledger Reconciliation**
    *   **Description:** Payroll registers are matched against ledger postings so differences are identified early, with clear reasons and suggested corrections. Ensure your ADP/Gusto output perfectly matches your GL.
*   **Feature 04: Real-time people cost reporting during close**
    *   **Description:** Track total people cost accurately across entities and departments, including fixed vs variable components, without waiting for the final close. Monitor spend vs. last month ($205K current vs $120K engineering) instantly.
